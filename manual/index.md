Products are the individual items that you are selling in your Reaction store. With Reaction, you can create and edit products inline with the same view your clients will see. No removed administrator views, just simple product management.

### Create a Product

Note: You will need to be logged in as a user with permissions to manage products (see <a href="#accounts">Accounts</a> to learn more)

To create a product, click the “+” button at the top of any product page.
