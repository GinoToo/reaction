Products are the individual items that you are selling in your Reaction store. With Reaction, you can create and edit products inline with the same view your clients will see. No separate administrator views, just simple product management.

<h3 id="products-creating">Creating Products</h3>

To create a product, first log in as a user with permissions to manage products (see [Accounts](#dashboard-accounts)), then click the Add Product button (![Add icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/icon-add.png)) at the top of any product page.

You will then be taken to a view of your new product where you can simply click into and edit the available fields as well as [Add Variants](#products-variants).

You can also clone an existing product by clicking the Clone icon (![Clone icon](http://placehold.it/14x14)) on any product.

Until you choose to make a product visible, it is by default hidden from the public. To make a product visible, either click the Visibility icon (![Visibility icon](http://placehold.it/14x14)) from the grid view or the “Make visible” link in the detail view.

<h3 id="products-editing">Editing Products</h3>

In Reaction, products are editing from the same view the client sees. All you need to do is log in as a user with sufficient permissions (see [Accounts](#dashboard-accounts)) and click on the product you wish to edit. From the product detail view, you can click to change any field.

<h3 id="products-variants">Product Variants</h3>

Product variants allow you to create variations of the same base product. You can specify different prices, weights, quanities and other key information for each variant. An example of variants is carrying multiple sizes and colors of a given shirt.

To create a variant, select the Clone icon (![Clone icon](http://placehold.it/14x14)) next to the original variant that appeared when the product was first created.

From there you can edit the information and [add images and videos](#product-media) for that specific variant.

<h3 id="products-media">Product Media</h3>

In Reaction, you can easily add images and video to show off your products. Each [variant](#products-variants) has it's own media gallery.

To add media to the gallery, just click on a variant and press the "Add media" button.
